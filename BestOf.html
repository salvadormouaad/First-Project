  <h1>Ranking the Best Moments of LeBron James's Career</h1>
  <p><span>The King is officially the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Where does Tuesds record-breaking moment rank in his illustrious career?</span></p>

   <p>Whittling down the most indelible, audacious, singular moments from an unparalleled 20-year career is not easy. LeBron James might be the greatest basketball player ever, a totemic image of athleticism, poise, discipline, and durability all wrapped into one unfading 6-foot-9 body. He's played more than 53,000 minutes and dunked it 2,438 times (including this one over another human being, this one through another, and this one for the art exhibits).</p>
   <p>His on- and off-court decisions have changed and elevated the NBA in a way few others can claim to have done. And now that he's broken a record that's stood since eight months before he was born, it's worth recollecting some of the most significant memories this legend has provided along the way. Here are my top eight.
   </p>
   <h3>5. 25 Straight!</h3>
   <p>In 2007, making just his second playoff appearance, 22-year-old LeBron swept the Wizards, needed only six games to take down the Jason Kidd-Vince Carter Nets, and then, miraculously, wiped the floor with a proud Pistons team that was three years removed from raising the Larry O'Brien Trophy.</p>
   <p>If anyone did what he did in Game 5 of that series in 2023, the 14 engineers who still work at Twitter would melt trying to keep feeds up and running. The Cavs held a one-point lead with 6:06 left in regulation, and LeBron had just 19 points. In the remaining 6:05, plus 10 minutes from two overtime periods, James would drop another 29 points, including 25 straight, and carry the Cavaliers to what was then easily one of their biggest wins in franchise history.</p>

   <p>
    LeBron was destined for greatness, but even this felt unfathomable. Players that young don't lead 50-win teams to the NBA Finals, nor do they shrug off battle-tested champions. They take their lumps, spend years getting knocked down, and then eventually climb the mountain. This night was a sign of just how different LeBron really was.
   </p>
   <h3>4. Game 1 of the 2018 NBA Finals</h3>
   <p>LeBron's second-best playoff game is forever handcuffed to a 10-point loss, endless memes, and a missed opportunity so frustrating it led him to punch a blackboard and injure his hand. So much of it represents a missed opportunity: JR Smith committed an all-time brain fart after George Hill missed what could've been a game-winning free throw with four seconds on the clock. James immediately labeled it one of the toughest losses of his entire career.</p>
   <p>But this game, which featured his playoff career high of 51 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists in nearly 48 minutes of action, is still beyond impressive. James nearly took down the defending champs single-handedly. Golden State threw Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson at him—familiar foes who had ended two of his last three seasons with losses. After a particularly rough defeat against Golden State in the 2017 Finals, in Game 1 of this 2018 championship series, it felt like a dam that had held over a year's worth of pent-up disappointment and determination had cracked.</p>

   <p>LeBron made 60 percent of his shots, repeatedly hunted Steph Curry, dropped several pull-up bombs in transition, and lived at the rim. There was no answer for him, as there never really has been. Had he stolen that game, nobody can say for sure what would've happened next. This was a once-in-a-lifetime superstar at the absolute peak of his powers. Even if Cleveland was eventually swept and LeBron no longer had Kyrie Irving (a necessary supplement who had helped James lead the Cavs back from a 3-1 deficit two years prior) by his side, why couldn't he do the impossible?</p>
   <h3>3. The Headband-less Masterpiece</h3>
   <p>Game 6 of the 2013 Finals contained what might be the most riveting possession in NBA history: Ray Allen's backpedaling prayer from the corner forced overtime and is in the “Most Unforgettable Shots Ever” conversation. Everyone who saw it live still remembers where they were when it happened. (I was quietly jumping on a couch in a dim Santa Monica studio apartment while my wife slept 15 feet away.)</p>
   <p>It's rare for LeBron to be overshadowed in a game this meaningful, particularly one that featured one of his most pivotal stints. At the nine-minute mark in the fourth quarter, his headband came off, he didn't put it back on, and then things really got serious. All this somehow happened a decade ago, and it's jarring to go back and watch highlights of LeBron's athletic prime. But it's all on full display right here. He had a different gear back then, whether it was how he accelerated without a runway or got off the ground in a split second. (LeBron's out-of-nowhere volleyball spike of Tim Duncan's layup is epic.)</p>

   <p>The Heat trailed by 10 after three quarters. James scored 14 points with no headband, including what, in my opinion, is the most important shot of his entire career: Down five with 20 seconds left, he canned a 3 from the left wing mere moments after badly bricking one straightaway. Allen would never have gotten a chance to hit the biggest shot of his life if that hadn't gone in. LeBron was unconscious in that moment, and it capped off a stretch that pretty much defines how he evolved to become one of the great scorers of all time.</p>
   <h3>2. The Block</h3>
   <p>It feels odd to memorialize one of the greatest offensive players in NBA history—on the day he broke the leagu's all-time scoring record—with a defensive play. But that's why we'll never see another LeBron James.</p>
   <p>It's impossible to top this, the defining sequence of his career, a swift, sensational display of athleticism and timing that will one day be immortalized in bronze in downtown Cleveland. You've seen it 1 million times because it deserves that level of attention. How he did it defies comprehension.</p>

   <p>To race down the court as he did, physically exhausted, on the only path that would yield a favorable outcome, LeBron summoned the concentration of a monk and the momentum of an asteroid. He didn't think he could get there. He took off knowing he would. And with a little help from JR Smith, he did.

    LeBron would still be one of the greatest players ever even if he hadn't brought Cleveland the trophy that had long felt preordained by his arrival back in 2003. But in his eyes, this third ring is what makes him the best basketball player who ever lived. And while it's still possible that could've happened without this play, no other moment better symbolizes what it took for him to get there.</p>
